# iPhonePrefsURLs
List of Settings URLs to launch "prefs:root" URLs via the Shortcuts app in iOS.

Original work done by Federico Viticci for his article on the [macstories.net](https://www.macstories.net/ios/a-comprehensive-guide-to-all-120-settings-urls-supported-by-ios-and-ipados-13-1/) titled:

"A Comprehensive Guide to All 120+ Settings URLs Supported by iOS and iPadOS 13.1"
BY FEDERICO VITICCI

# Why make this?

Short answer, I could not find the prefs url that I wanted to use for my own Shortcuts.

Long answer, current iPhone operating system that I am using is iOS 16.0.3. I hope this might be a much easier way for people to help collaborate or help to keep the list updated.
