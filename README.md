# Why make this?

Short answer, I could not find the prefs url (or URL schemas) that I wanted to use for my own Shortcuts.

Long answer, current iPhone operating system that I am using is iOS 16.0.3, and it's been a while since the original article has been update.

Also, hopefully this is an easier way to keep the list updated.

Of course, there's always [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/).
